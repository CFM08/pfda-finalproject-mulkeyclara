I plan to make a memory game, one where you have to remember the order of colors and shapes in a certain order. You'll be prompted with an order that you will than have to repeat for three rounds to win.

## Planned features: 
      Randomization of 9 colors that will flash on the screen: By giving the program multiple choices to choose at random.
      9 colors appear on screen for you to click: As learned from lab 08, seperating the screen into 9 options for the player to choose.
      Mouse interaction: Exploring through pygame.
      Different screens: Looking through pygame to execute different screens depending on status of game.

## Challenges:
      Furthur exploration of pygame and it's usage. Allows for me to learn more uses of pygame.
      How to make a notable shift in colors depending on the sequence.

## Ideal Outcome:
      Flashes of colors will go across the screen than shifting to 3 x 3 grid of colors, allows for the player to choose the sequence show. This goes for three rounds, and depending on what you pick
      you will get different resulting screens: Round Completed, Round Failed, You Win.

## Minimal Viable Outcome:
      Flashes of colors, colors presented in 3 x 3 grid for player to choose. Resulting screens announcing game status.

## Milestones:
     # 1 Week: Screens Designed
     # 2 Week: Groundwork all done
     # 3 Week: Beta Testing & Alterations
     # 4 Week: Final Touches
